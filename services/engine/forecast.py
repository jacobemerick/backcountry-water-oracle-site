backcountry-water-oracle -- forecast engine
===========================================
Estimate whether a backcountry water source (seep / spring / creek / falls) is
likely to be running, by correlating its historical field observations against
~19 years of daily precipitation for its coordinates.

This is the deterministic ENGINE. It is format-agnostic: it consumes a single
normalized CSV and knows nothing about any particular report website. Turning
messy real-world reports (hikeArizona, FarOut comments, trail spreadsheets, your
own notes) into that CSV is the job of the `/water-forecast` skill (or you, by
hand). See README.md for the schema and the skill.

Input CSV schema (header required; extra columns ignored):
    source,lat,lon,date,score[,status]
      source  free-text name/id (rows with the same name are one source)
      lat,lon decimal degrees
      date    ISO YYYY-MM-DD
      score   FLOAT 0.0 .. 1.0   (0.0 = dry, 1.0 = max observed flow)
      status  optional raw text, carried for provenance only

Usage:
    python3 forecast.py examples/mazatzal-wilderness.csv
    python3 forecast.py a.csv b.csv                     # combine several files
    python3 forecast.py sources.csv --asof 2026-08-15   # read for a future date
    python3 forecast.py sources.csv --no-cache          # force precip re-fetch
    python3 forecast.py area.csv --pool-radius 15       # neighbor radius km (pooling)
    python3 forecast.py area.csv --no-pool              # analyze each source alone
    cat area.csv | python3 forecast.py -                # read the CSV from stdin
    python3 forecast.py area.csv --json                 # machine-readable output

EMBEDDING IT (hosts):
    import forecast
    forecast.PRECIP_PROVIDER = my_provider   # (lat, lon, end_date, use_cache)
    rows = [forecast.analyze(s, asof) for s in forecast.load_sources(["x.csv"])]
  The precip backend is the one seam a host needs: swap it to read the series
  from a shared store (Postgres/KV) instead of this script's .cache/ directory.
  Still stdlib-only, still no change to the CLI. See PRECIP_PROVIDER below.

PIPING IT AROUND:
  * `-` as a filename reads the CSV from stdin (and stdin is used automatically
    when no files are given and stdin is not a terminal), so the engine drops
    into a pipeline: your normalizer | forecast.py - --json | your consumer.
  * `--json` prints one JSON object on stdout instead of the text report -- every
    number the text report shows, unrounded-to-4dp, plus the run's parameters.
    In --json mode all diagnostics ([skip]/[error]) go to stderr and are also
    collected under "notes", so stdout stays valid JSON.

Pure standard library. No pip installs. Precip: Open-Meteo ERA5 archive (free).

TRUST IT THIS MUCH:
  * ERA5 precip is ~9-11 km grid -> it SMOOTHS/MISSES isolated monsoon cells.
    Trust the winter-recharge signal; for a summer "did a storm just hit" call,
    still eyeball radar (MRMS / AHPS). This gives the base rate, not this week.
  * Season and rain are entangled (more reports in wet, cool months). The tool
    removes the day-of-year cycle (annual-harmonic regression, learned from each
    site's own precip so it's hemisphere-correct anywhere) and reports a
    SEASON-CONTROLLED r beside each raw r. Classification, the best-predictor,
    and the analog read all key off the controlled r. It can collapse a small-n
    source's headline (e.g. Castersen's raw .72/180d -> ~.09 controlled).
  * Small-n sources (< ~25 reports) are suggestive, not solid (flagged below).
  * POOLING: sources within --pool-radius km (default 25) borrow correlation
    strength from each other. Each source's per-window season-controlled r is
    shrunk toward its neighbors by empirical Bayes (posterior-mean between-source
    variance under a weakly-informative half-Cauchy prior): a group whose members
    agree pools hard, a group that disagrees barely pools, and a small-n source
    leans on neighbors more than a data-rich one does at every window. Geography
    only picks the neighborhood; the data decide how much to borrow. --no-pool
    turns it off. Only the correlation is pooled -- %-dry and the flow numbers
    stay each source's own.

# Precipitation: a swappable provider
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Everything downstream needs is one daily series per coordinate:
#
#     provider(lat, lon, end_date, use_cache) -> {"daily": {"time": [ISO...],
#                                                 "precipitation_sum": [inches...]}}
#
# The default provider fetches Open-Meteo's ERA5 archive and caches it under
# CACHE_DIR. An embedding host (a web app on serverless, say) that needs the
# series in a shared store instead can assign its own callable:
#
#     import forecast
#     forecast.PRECIP_PROVIDER = my_postgres_provider   # same signature
#
# ...and the engine will use it everywhere, with no new dependency and no change
# to the CLI. A host that only wants different STORAGE can wrap the built-in:
# call open_meteo_provider() on a miss and keep the result wherever it likes.
# CACHE_DIR itself is assignable too, for the simple "just put it elsewhere" case.
#
# Contract notes:
#   * `time` must be ascending ISO dates; `precipitation_sum` inches, same length.
#     None is allowed and read as 0.0. The series should start at PRECIP_START --
#     a short one silently shortens the analog pool it can draw on.
#   * `end_date` is the latest day the caller needs. Returning MORE than that is
#     fine (the engine trims), which lets a host keep one series per coordinate
#     and serve every as-of date from it.
#   * `use_cache=False` means "the caller wants fresh data" -- bypass your cache.
